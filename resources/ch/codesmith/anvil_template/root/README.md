## Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

FIXME: choose correct artifact section

### for deps artifacts
Include the following dependencies in your[deps.edn](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli):

```
io.github.codesmith-gmbh/anvil {:git/tag "v0.0.0" :git/sha "????"}
```

### for mvn artifacts
Include the following dependencies in your[deps.edn](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli):

```
{{group/id}}/{{artifact/id}} {:mvn/version "0.0.0"}
```

### for docker artifacts

```bash
docker pull {{group/id}}/{{artifact/id}}:0.0.0
```

Invoke a library API function from the command-line:

    $ clojure -X {{top/ns}}.{{main/ns}}/foo :a 1 :b '"two"'
    {:a 1, :b "two"} "Hello, World!"

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build a JAR (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the JAR in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

Install it locally (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment
variables (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build deploy

Your library will be deployed to {{group/id}}/{{artifact/id}} on clojars.org by default.
